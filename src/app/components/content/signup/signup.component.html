            All we ask is that you make a commitment to digital participation. That could mean a plan to skill up your own workforce, an offer you’re making to the wider community, a commitment to building basic digital skills for your tenants, clients or service users, or whatever fits best for your organisation. We’re happy to work with you to find out what might work best. You can see <a [routerLink]="['/stories']">case study examples</a> of what some other organisations have done, or you can <a [routerLink]="['/contact-us']">contact us</a> for more information.
